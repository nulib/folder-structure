Some additional notes:

-Folder names should be all lowercase

-The parent folder for all items of a specific format should correspond to the format (i.e. “Audio” for audio works, “Video” for video works, and “Film” for film works)

-The name of the metadata folder can be shortened to “meta” (this is a change from what we had previously requested in our vendor specifications)

-MD5 files should always be placed in the same folder as their associated files with one MD5 file per file, with the exception of DPX sequences, which should have one MD5 file for the entire sequence. The contents of the MD5 file should be standard binary mode formatting with relative file paths (checksum [single space] * filename.file): 498cdaf0e7634f94572bbd2c2ec6fdb1 *my_file_p.mov
